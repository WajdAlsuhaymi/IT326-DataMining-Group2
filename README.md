# Social Media Usage and Emotional Well-Being  

## Project Information  
The Social Media Usage and Emotional Well-Being dataset explores how people’s social media habits—such as time spent and platforms used—relate to their emotional states. It combines usage patterns, demographic details, and self-reported well-being, making it useful for analyzing the impact of digital behavior on mental health and guiding healthier online engagement.

## Project Motivation  
This project focuses on the Social Media Usage and Emotional Well-Being dataset because social media has a major influence on daily life and mental health. While it can provide connection and support, excessive or unhealthy use is linked to anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Studying this dataset is important to understand how usage patterns affect emotional well-being, identify positive and negative impacts, and provide insights for individuals, educators, and policymakers. The goal is to promote healthier digital habits and improve overall well-being.
